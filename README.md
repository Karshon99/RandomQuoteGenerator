# RandomQuoteGenerator
FreeCodeCamp Challenge
This is my first vanilla JavaScript project where I began my path as a web developer. 
A simple web app that randomly displays a set of predefined quotes.
Working on this project allowed me to get accustomed to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with generating dynamic elements.
